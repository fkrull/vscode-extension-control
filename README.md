# Extension Control: a better way to manage VS Code extensions

abstract

## Documentation

## Planned Features

This is a non-exhaustive list of things I'd like to add. This is currently *not*
ordered by priority.

* installing extensions from local VSIX files
* update locally installed extensions
* install extension dependencies
* optionally remove extensions that are installed, but not declared in the
  configuration
* automatically run on editor startup
* automatically run when the configuration file is edited
* generate the configuration file from installed extensions
